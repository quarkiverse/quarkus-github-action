= Generating Github Action Workflows

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

== Overview

It is often desirable to either generate a new workflow or update an existing one.
This project provides a CLI that can be used for this purpose.
More specifically, it can (re)generate a simple worklflow you can use when pushing 
to a branch and / or when creating a pull request, that:

- is aligned to the jdk version you are using.
- is aligned to the build tool you are using (e.g. Maven or Gradle)

== Installation

The CLI plugin is installable to all Quarkus projects using the `quarkus-github-action-workflow-generator` extension.
However, it can also be used even without the extension. In this case, the CLI plugin needs to be added manually.

[source,shell]

== Using the CLI

The CLI plugin provides the `quarkus github-action generate` command.
When the command is executed, it will generate a workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory.
